        <p>Well, in one part of the instructions it says to include at least 1 picture of me or my work here.
        But in another portion of the instructions, it tells us to only... No wait. I remember now.
        That part was supposed to say "Using at least the following." My Bad. Here's a Picture. :D</p>

        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>My name is Jacob Wiles. My birthday is December 26th, 1997, and I am currently 22 years old.
        I am currently dual enrolled at Grand Rapids Community College and Ferris State University going for a Digital Animation and Game Design degree.
        I still live at home w/ both of my parents and my younger brother, although I still have to pay my "land lords" rent.
        We have two li'l dogs named Lacey and Molly. They're both getting kinda old, well into the double digits.
        I like to code and either make or remake games (turning irl games into digital versions) while watching YouTube videos, listening to music, or sometimes Twitch streams.
        I usually find that my personality can be very paradoxical. I can be a perfectionist at times, yet totally complacent about the same thing in about a minute.
        Dispite that, I am always under the belief that creative projects like videos, movies, music, games, etc. never actually get finished. "They just get released." -Wren from Corridor Digital.
        That means that everything you see in the world of Multimedia is never truely in it's final/complete state. There is always more that could have been done. There are always ways to make it better.
        What you get is the result that the people who worked on it got to before thier boss(s) said, "You're done." 
        That's why nowadays things get patched over the internet, proof that what you're playing still isn't finished when you bought them, or even as you are playing it.</p>
        <!-- Insert "Why I Make Games" Paragraph Here: -->
        <h3>Why I Make Games</h3>
        <p>I have been designing games since I was a kid. Although, I guess the proper term for it would be "re-desiging" games. I'd always experiment with trying to change the rules of the games we played to see what would 
        happen. Although, I once made a video game IN PAPER that people could play and take actions in where the results would be determined by playing Rock-Paper-Siscors against me. It was kind of like a 2d DnD w/ less 
        fantasey.</p>
        <p>Then in 6th grade, as part of one of my classes, I took the online Carrear Cruizing test. As it turned out, a few of my top picks were 3D Modeller and Video Game Designer. When I saw those and it finally
            clicked in my mind that it was somebody's JOB to make all those video games I liked playing, I knew I found exactly what I wanted to do. Shortly there after, my mom found the summer camp courses offered 
            by this campus. There, I worked in UDK and in later years UE4, and after Blueprinting in UE4, I fell in love. From there it was only a manner of learning other programs like 3DS Max, Blender, Gimp, and 
        Photoshop, half of which I forgot how to use by the time I enrolled in Ferris.</p>
        <p>But if I were to say "why" I make games, it is probably b/c I want to create an experience for others. And not only that but I want to SEE them experience it. That right there is personally the best part about 
        making games for me.</p>
