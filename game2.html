            <h2>RULES OF THE GAME</h2>
            <p>Equipment: The game of Gobblet consists of a 16-square playing board and 24 playing pieces called gobblets: 12 white and 12 black.</p>
            <div id="quickRules">
                <h3>Object of the Game</h3>
                Be the first player to align 4 gobblets in a row.
                <h3>Quick Start</h3>
                In turns, players can either:
                <ul>
                    <li>Put a new gobblet on the board.</li>
                    <li>Move one of their gobblets already on the board to any empty space.</li>
                    <li>Gobble up any smaller size gobblet already on the board with a bigger one.</li>
                </ul>
                The first player to align 4 gobblets in a row wins.
            </div>
            <h3>Object of the Game</h3>
            <p>Be the first player to align 4 gobblets in a row.</p>
            <h3>Setting Up</h3>
            <p>Each player chooses a color and arranges his gobblets in 3 stacks of 4 gobblets each. Only the 3 biggest gobblets are showing at the beginning. These stacks are called external stacks.</p>
            <h3>Playing</h3>
            <p>In turns, players can either put a new gobblet on the board, move one of their gobblets already on the board to any empty space or gobble up any smaller gobblet with a bigger gobblet already in play.</p>
            <p>If you put a new gobblet in play, you must place it on an empty square. However, there is one exception to this rule: if your opponent already has 3 gobblets in a row on the board, you may gobble up to 1 of the 3 pieces in the line with a gobblet taken directly from one of your external stacks.</p>
            <p>If you place all 12 of your pieces on the board before the game is over, you simply continue playing with the pieces on the board until a winner or a draw is declared.</p>
            <h3>Winning</h3>
            <p>The first player to align 4 gobblets in a row wins. The gobblets forming the line do not all have to be the same size and can be lined up vertically, horizontally or diagonally.</p>

                <h3>Notes on Play</h3>
                <p><strong>Playing from Stacks: </strong>Players must play pieces in the order they appear, starting from the top.</p>
                <p><strong>Playing from the Board: </strong>Gobblets must be lifted to ensure that only one piece is moved at a time.</p>
                <p><strong>Gobbling: </strong>You can gobble up your own pieces. You can gobble up any smaller size gobblet; it does not have to be the next size down.</p>
                <p><strong>Touched Gobblet: </strong>Once you touch a gobblet that is on the board you must play it. If you touch a gobblet that cannot be played, you automatically lose that game.</p>
                <p><strong>Uncovering Gobblets: </strong>You can move any gobblet on the board whether it is coverning another gobblet or not. However, if you uncover one of your opponent's pieces, and this move reveals a line of 4 of your opponent's pieces, you lose unless you can place your gobblet over a different piece in this same line.</p>
                <p><strong>Draws: </strong>The game is declared a draw if 3 repetitions of identical moves between whites and blacks occur or by mutual agreement between players.</p>
                <p><strong>Ages: </strong>Gobblet is intended to challenge player ages 7 to adult.</p>

            <h3>Playing in a Web Browser</h3>
