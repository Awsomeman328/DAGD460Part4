Welcome to the Kewl Games Korner!
This is a website designed for my DAGD 460 course, Multimedia 2: Web Game Development.
As such, this website is initically designed as an online arcade, filled with the games of my own making.
These games were either made before this class began, or were specifically created for various assignments in creating this site.
Apart from these games, this site also includes an about me and contact me page, pages for other homework that were not specifallcy game related, and a whole section that presents our in-class examples and exersices from each week.
I hope you all have fun in my Kewl Korner of the internet!
