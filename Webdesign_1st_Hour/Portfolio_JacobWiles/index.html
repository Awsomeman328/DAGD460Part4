<h3>Unit 2</h3>
<p>	Well in Unit 2, I learned how to make this entire web page from scratch using Notepad.
I learned how to do this with HTML markup and code. I've coded before at Ferris State
University at the section they have at Grand Rapids Community College during a summer camp that
lasted a week.This was a good way to get back to a simular format and learn a few things.
I also learned how to make lists and tables using these things I've learned so far.</p>

<h3>Unit 3</h3>
<p>	In this Unit, Unit 3, I learned how to code in a different language. I already learned from 
the previous two Units how to sode in HTML format, and this this Unit, I learned how to code 
in CSS format. CSS isn't used to make websites exactly, it's used to style and "dress up" a 
website. It adds color, order shapes, and individuality to a site while keeping a good general 
theme, although it is possible to stray from that general theme if one is not careful.</p>
<p>	This unit also tought me how to understand and apply typography, The Box Model, and ID and 
Classes in CSS. In a brief summary, typography is a fancy word for text styling, The Box Model 
is the three layers that sorrounds an object and can change the properties of those elements, 
and the ID and Classes allows us to group certain part(s) of a site to make it/them disticnt 
from the rest.</p>
<p>	The last thing I learned from this Unit was some Page Layout Techniques, and this one took 
the longest because of it's complexity and multiple things going wrong to hidder my progress 
with this subject, both in myeslf and in the machine. But anyway, a Page Layout allows a 
web designer to "defy the laws of gravity." Normally, a site would be stacked one block of 
information ontop of another. But with some techniques, they can float right next to each 
other.

<h3>Unit 4</h3>
<p><a href="graphics.html">
  <img src="images/Real_Button5Camera.jpg" width="72" height="72" alt="Camera Button"></a></p>
<p>	In Unit 4, learned about Web and internet graphics, creating a web photo album, and 
how to create a button and web page benner.</p>
<p>	When startind off, I learned about the different qualities of web graphics like 
resalution and copyright usage. Knowing this helped me make a web photo album and understand 
web grapgics better. I also learned how to acquire safe photos for my site that had allowed me 
to use, crop, resize, and add to my web page.</p>
<p>	After that, I went on to making a button, like the button above, using basic shapes and colors and working 
with layers in the graphics program(s) I used, paint and GIMP. I started with paint, but it 
was so limited with what it could do. But when my teacher saw me using it, he said we had GIMP 
which was kind of hard to learn right off the bat on my own, but I soon got the hang of it. 
Then, I got to work with optimizing GIF Images and creating a Favicon, which worked in Firefox 
and Chrome, but not internet explorer. my teacher had numerous problems where the other two 
wouldn't work but internet explorer would, but not the other way around.</p>
<p>	Last thing I did was create a web page banner, using selection tools and layer effects 
and blending, and work with background images, which sucked because,as you can probably see, 
I have to keep it on repeat instead of streatching out the entire thing like I wanted. But I 
can't spend to much time on it because I'm already behind. I was supposed to get this done + 
some of Unit 5 done last week Teusday. Now I have to get to lesson 53 (this part right here is 
46) by this friday. GOT TO GO FAST!</p>

<h3>Unit 5</h3>
<p>In the Unit 2 reflections paragraph above, I talked about how I coded before and HTML was kind of familliar to me. Well in unit 5 
I got that same feeling, but this one was more familiar. I worked with C++ before and Javascript is a simular coding language that scripts events 
together to happen. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself. In Unit 5 I learned about scripting, and more specificly, Client-side vs. Server-side 
scripting, Javascript and how to debug errors, and how to use Javascript to manipulate values from HTML and CSS at the same time. I was able to 
understand a little of when the actual code itself was saying to get what was going on, but some of it at the end went a little over my head.</p>

<h3>Unit 6</h3>
<p>During this Unit, all the days have been spaced apart by christmas break. I only really 
needed to do one more thing when I came back. I know I might forget about some things, but 
I'll try my best to list everything.</p>
<p>Ok, so, Unit 6 was all about Quality Control. All I did was Validate and test everthing 
about my website. And now that I'm actually reading the list on lessons I did, I can remember 
some big highlights that happened during the Unit. So, first thing I did was validate my HTML 
code, followed by validating my CSS style sheet, and it was absalutely awful. I started out 
doing this homepage, the index, and i think I started off with somewhat of about 19 or 20 
errors! Luckily it was the biggest page I had/have, so everything after that was either a 
repeat mistake, copied & pasted to all the other webpages, or something completely different. 
Of course, the worst thing that happened this entire Unit was when I tried to validate my CSS 
sheet. ... Over 30 errors right off the bat. I just could not comprehend what it all ment. By 
the time I got down to about 20, Mr. Schneider came in and started working on it himself. I 
guess he could tell I was either struggleing or falling behind. Oh yeah, after this, I would 
have 58 out of 68 lessons done, putting me at 85.294% complete. Right now I can't clearly tell 
how far I have to be right now, but if I had to guess, I think I'm supposed to be at 93.22%. 
But I'm not sure, and anyway, back on track. After that I validated the Accessibility of my 
school's home page, finding a number of errors that could be adressed.</p>
<p>The last thing I did was conduct a usability test on my website. I had my two, not friends 
exactly, people I know that I sometimes have fun with, try to find three things in my site. 
Two of them were pretty easy because One was correctly labeled, another they saw in the home 
page so they could find that one quicker, but the last one was tricky because it really isn't 
in a spot you'd think to look, but that's all right.</p>

<h3>Unit 7</h3>
<p>Unit 7 is the last Unit I have to complete before Unit 8 dealing w/ client Websites. In Unit
 7, I learned about Web authoring software, things that make it easy for people without the 
knowlage I have to make websites all on their own. I didn't deal much w/ that.</p>
<p>What I mainly focused on this lesson was Website Hosting Servicies and Publishing tools, 
and now that I know about those, I can make my own website for all to see on the World Wide Web!</p>
