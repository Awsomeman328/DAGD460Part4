  Well the main problem I see is that who ever coded this site didn't spend attention to detail.
Over half of the pictures does not have alternative text, some of images being very important 
because they are links to other pages in the website. Also, something completely obvious but 
no one ever noticed it, there's no title or heading to the page. There is also on link that 
repeats another link already present. Lastly, there apears to be a form missing from the search 
bar in the top right hand corner of the page, whatever they mean by form.
</p>
<p>
  So there are a lot of easy fixes for all of these problems. 
  <ol>
    <il>For the images missing alternative texts, just add them into html. Really, it isn't that hard.</li>
    <li>For the missing title, just add one in.</li>
    <li>Now that we got the easy stuff out of the way, another problem that could be fixed is the repeating links. There is multiple things you could to to fix this. 1)Remove the link in the District Communications box. 2) You could remove the picture with the original link on it. This could also help you solve your alternative text problem, but only if you're lazy. But if you take the second option, that page may not be visited much because it's not so, oh what's the word? Obvious, ... inviting as the picture. But there is a third option. 3) Just do nothing about it. This and the no heading thing isn't really a problem at all, thry're just alerts meaning they maybe important in other cases and you may want to look at it, but you don't have to.</li>
    <li>Now for the missing form thing, I have no clue what that means. I say you should go look it up what i means and you figure it out, I don't have time to right now. Sorry.</li>
 </ol>
