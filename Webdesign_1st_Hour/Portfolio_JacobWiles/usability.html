  <h1>Usability Study</h1>

  <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>I studied my website.<br>
    The target audience would be my friends and possible future subscribers to my YouTube channel. For now, just me & my friends.<br>
    I had them do three tasks:<ul><li>Open up the Java Clock</li><li>Use a link to get to my YouTube channel</li><li>Find/Use the link to get to Serebii.net</li></ul></p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Yes, eventually both completed all three tasks.<br>
    The third one took them a while, but they found them all smothly enough.<br>
    Task one took them both 2 steps, one to get to the page and the other to open the clock. Task two took them two steps as well, one to return to the home page, one to open the link. 
The third task was the tricky one; it took them at least 2-3 steps before they figured out the right page was on.</p>

  <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>That giving someone a task to do something that doesn't follow logic, or something irrelivent to the page beside some minor content and references, may not be a valid test.<br>
    So far, mostly yes, because everything works, everything looks good, it's just that not everything is, I don't know how to call it, uhhm ... certain things don't quite belong.<br>
    I could add another page that holds all out sourced links including my YouTube Channel link, Serebii.net, Comstock Park Public Schools Website, just everything I got that leads to things I don't personally own.</p>
