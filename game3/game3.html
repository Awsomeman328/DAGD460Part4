	<p>The boss has gone wild! Defeat him before he takes you down!</p>
	<p>Use the WASD keys or arrow keys to move around. Overlapp your character to deal damage to the boss. But watch out for the boss's attacks, b/c they hurt back.</p>
	<p>Currently the boss's attacks include: 
		<ul>
			<li>A teleport that is basically impossible to dodge. Just pray</li>
			<li>A charge from one side of the screen to the other.</li>
			<li>A beam that spans the screen</li>
			<li>A spam of projectiles (currently not implamented)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>The player also regenerates their health every second, so if you need to hang back, fell free to. And if you feel like taking some risks, go right ahead.</p>
	<p>To reset the game, refresh the page for hit F5 on your keyboard</p>
