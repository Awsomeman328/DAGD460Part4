        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This is one of the first video games I made in DAGD. It's current version is quite bare bones. 
        You use your mouse to aim the turret at the  bottom of the screen and left click to shoot at the falling boxes. There is also some sweet particle effects to go with it.</p>
        <h2>Screenshots:</h2>

        <h2>Download Link:</h2>
        <p>After clicking on <a href="v4.zip">this link</a>, your browser should begin downloading the zip file. Once it has downloaded, unzip the folder in whatever unzipping program/method you prefer. (If you don't know how to unzip a folder, go Google it to learn how. (Don't forget to purchase WinRar.)) Once you have unzipped the folder, open it and navigate to the main01.swf file and double click. Be careful to double click the correct file as there are multiple files with the main01 name but with different file extensions. Also make sure you have Adobe Flash Player installed on your computer, otherwise you won't be able to play. However, if you have Adobe Animate installed on your computer, then you can double click the main01.fla file instead and hit the play button inside of Animate.</p>
        <p>If you are having difficulties getting the downloaded files to function properly, 
        <a href="v4/main01.html">try this link</a> instead.
        It should run the file directly in your browser for you to play. If you are unable to download Adobe Flash to your desktop, this link should be for you. Note that this only works for browsers that have Flash installed on them. Google Chrome has Adobe Flash natively, but if you are using a different browser, you may need to install it on your current browser, or download Google Chrome. If your browser is blocking Adobe Flash from playing, consult your browser's Security and Privacey Options/Settings. Make sure that your browser is not blocking/preventing Flash from playing. Important to know abou this option however is some browsers are dropping Flash support soon, so this may not work in the future.</p>
